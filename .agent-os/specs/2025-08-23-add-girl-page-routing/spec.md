# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Add Girl Page and Routing Integration
> Created: 2025-08-23

## Overview

Implement the /add-girl page with Next.js App Router integration that serves as the first step in the girl profile onboarding flow. This page will integrate the ProfileForm component with proper routing, SEO metadata, PWA optimization, and progress indicators to guide users through the complete onboarding experience.

## User Stories

### New Girl Profile Creation

As a CPN user, I want to access a dedicated /add-girl page, so that I can start tracking a new girl's information in an organized, step-by-step process.

The user navigates to /add-girl, sees a clean form interface with progress indicators showing "Step 1 of [X]", fills out the initial profile information using the ProfileForm component, and upon successful submission is guided to the next step in the onboarding flow with clear navigation cues.

### Mobile-Optimized Profile Entry

As a mobile user, I want the add girl page to be PWA-optimized with proper touch interfaces, so that I can easily enter profile data on my phone with a native app-like experience.

The page loads instantly via service worker caching, provides large touch targets for form inputs, includes haptic feedback on interactions, and maintains form state even if the user navigates away and returns later.

### SEO and Deep Linking Support

As a user sharing the app, I want the /add-girl page to have proper SEO metadata, so that shared links provide meaningful previews and the page can be bookmarked or accessed directly.

The page includes proper meta tags, OpenGraph data, structured data markup, and supports direct URL access with appropriate authentication checks and redirect flows.

## Spec Scope

1. **Next.js App Router Page** - Create /add-girl route using Next.js 14+ App Router with proper TypeScript integration
2. **ProfileForm Integration** - Integrate existing ProfileForm component with proper state management and validation
3. **SEO Metadata Configuration** - Implement comprehensive meta tags, OpenGraph, and structured data for optimal sharing
4. **PWA Optimization** - Ensure page works offline, has proper caching, and provides native app-like experience
5. **Progress Indicators** - Add visual progress tracking showing current step (1) in the overall onboarding flow
6. **Navigation Flow Management** - Implement routing logic to guide users to next onboarding step upon form completion

## Out of Scope

- Backend API integration for form submission (handled in existing ProfileForm component)
- Multi-step form wizard UI (this is specifically the first step page)
- User authentication logic (handled by existing middleware)
- Database schema changes (using existing profile data structure)
- Real-time form validation beyond existing ProfileForm capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional /add-girl page** - Browser-accessible route at /add-girl that renders properly and integrates ProfileForm component
2. **Complete navigation flow** - Form submission redirects to appropriate next step with proper state management
3. **PWA-compliant implementation** - Page works offline, has proper caching, and provides mobile-optimized experience
