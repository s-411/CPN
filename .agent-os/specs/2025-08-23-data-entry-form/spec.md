# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Basic Data Entry Form (date, cost, time, outcome)
> Created: 2025-08-23

## Overview

Create the data entry form as step 2 in the CPN onboarding funnel, allowing users to input their first dating interaction data (date, cost, time spent, outcome) immediately after profile creation. This form captures the essential metrics needed for CPN calculation while maintaining engagement momentum and guiding users toward the results page where they'll see their first personalized efficiency score.

## User Stories

### First Data Entry Experience
As a user who just completed the "Add Girl" profile creation, I want to immediately input my first dating interaction data, so that I can see my CPN calculation and understand the app's value proposition through actual results.

The user arrives from the profile creation page with context maintained, sees a clean form that feels like a natural next step, and can quickly input their dating data. The form should feel engaging and purposeful, with clear messaging about how this data generates their personalized efficiency score.

### Quick Interaction Logging
As a user tracking dating efficiency, I want to quickly log interaction details (date, cost, time, outcome), so that I can build a comprehensive dataset for analyzing my dating patterns and ROI.

The form should optimize for speed and accuracy with smart defaults, intuitive input methods, and mobile-first design. Each field should have clear purpose and the outcome selection should feel engaging rather than clinical. The interface should accommodate both successful and unsuccessful interactions without judgment.

### Onboarding Flow Progression
As a business stakeholder, I want this data entry to seamlessly progress users toward the CPN results page, so that they experience the app's core value proposition before being prompted to create an account.

The form should collect sufficient data for a meaningful CPN calculation while maintaining the user's engagement momentum. Clear progress indication and compelling messaging should guide users toward the results step where conversion opportunities increase significantly.

## Spec Scope

1. **Data Entry Form** - Clean, mobile-optimized form with date picker, cost input, time duration selector, and outcome choice (success/failure)
2. **Smart Input Methods** - Date picker for mobile, currency input with proper formatting, time duration picker, and engaging outcome selector
3. **Real-time Validation** - Client-side validation with helpful error messages and visual feedback using CPN design system
4. **Session Integration** - Seamlessly access profile data from previous step and store combined data for CPN calculation
5. **Progress Flow Management** - Smooth transition to CPN results page with all necessary data for first calculation
6. **Mobile-First UX** - Touch-optimized interface with large tap targets and gesture-friendly interactions

## Out of Scope

- Multiple interaction entries (single entry for onboarding)
- Advanced interaction categorization or detailed notes
- Data persistence beyond session storage (permanent storage happens after account creation)
- Historical data import or bulk entry features
- Complex validation beyond basic field requirements
- Social sharing features (happens later in results page)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Data Form** - All input fields work properly with validation and submit to generate CPN calculation data
2. **Seamless Flow Integration** - Form receives profile context from previous step and passes complete dataset to results page
3. **Mobile-Optimized Interface** - Touch-friendly inputs with proper keyboard types, date pickers, and gesture interactions
4. **Brand-Consistent Design** - Page uses CPN design system with engaging visual elements that maintain onboarding momentum
5. **Session Data Management** - Combined profile and interaction data stored temporarily and accessible for CPN calculation and results display
