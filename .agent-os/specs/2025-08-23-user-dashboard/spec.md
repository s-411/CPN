> Spec: Basic User Dashboard with Single Profile View
> Created: 2025-08-23

## Overview

Create a comprehensive user dashboard that displays a single user profile view with key CPN metrics, interactions history, and achievement tracking. This dashboard will serve as the primary interface for users to view their personal CPN data and track their progress over time.

## User Stories

### Primary Dashboard View

As a CPN user, I want to view my complete profile dashboard in one place, so that I can easily track my CPN score, interactions, and achievements without navigating between multiple pages.

The dashboard will display the user's profile information, current CPN score with peer comparison data, recent interaction history, earned achievements, and sharing analytics in a unified, visually appealing layout that follows the CPN design system.

### Interaction History Management

As a CPN user, I want to see my interaction history with cost analysis, so that I can understand my spending patterns and optimize my CPN investments.

The dashboard includes a detailed view of user interactions showing date, cost, time spent, nuts earned, and personal notes with the ability to view trends over time.

### Achievement Progress Tracking

As a CPN user, I want to see my earned achievements and available achievements, so that I can understand my progress and be motivated to continue improving my CPN score.

The achievement section displays earned achievements with timestamps and shows available achievements that can be unlocked, providing clear gamification elements to encourage engagement.

## Spec Scope

1. **Profile Information Display** - Show user's basic profile data including name, CPN score, and peer percentile ranking.
2. **CPN Score Visualization** - Display current score with category breakdowns and peer comparison metrics.
3. **Interaction History Table** - Present recent interactions with filtering and sorting capabilities.
4. **Achievement Gallery** - Show earned achievements and available achievements with progress indicators.
5. **Share Analytics Dashboard** - Display sharing history and platform-specific engagement metrics.

## Out of Scope

- Multi-user profile comparison views
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Profile editing capabilities (separate from viewing)
- Team-based dashboard features

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional single-page dashboard accessible at `/dashboard` that displays all user CPN data in an organized, visually appealing layout.
2. Responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices following the CPN design system.
3. Real-time data loading with proper error handling and loading states for all dashboard components.
