> Created: 2025-08-24

## Overview

Build a comprehensive responsive dashboard interface that provides data visualization and navigation for the CPN dating ROI optimization platform. This dashboard will serve as the primary user interface for tracking dating analytics, managing profiles, and accessing key features across desktop and mobile devices.

## User Stories

### Primary Dashboard Navigation

As a CPN user, I want to access all major platform features through an intuitive navigation system, so that I can efficiently manage my dating data and analytics from a single interface.

The dashboard provides centralized access to Profiles (Grils), overview, Analytics, Share, Leaderboards, Settings Subscription management, and Data Entry through a responsive navigation system that adapts between desktop sidebar and mobile bottom navigation patterns.

### Analytics Overview

As a data-driven dating optimizer, I want to view key metrics and trends at a glance, so that I can quickly assess my dating ROI performance and make informed decisions.

The dashboard presents critical stats including total spending, cost per interaction, time investment, and profile activity through visually clear cards with trend indicators and comparison data.

### Cross-Device Consistency

As a mobile-first user, I want the dashboard to work seamlessly across all my devices, so that I can access my dating analytics whether I'm on desktop or mobile.

The interface automatically adapts between desktop (sidebar navigation) and mobile (bottom tab navigation) layouts while maintaining consistent functionality and data presentation across all screen sizes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Responsive Navigation System** - Desktop sidebar with active highlights and mobile bottom tab navigation
2. **Statistics Cards Display** - Four primary metric cards showing total spend, cost efficiency, time tracking, and profile count
3. **Chart Placeholders** - Monthly spending trends and cost efficiency analysis visualization areas
4. **Recent Activity Feed** - Activity log display with empty state and call-to-action buttons
5. **Premium Upgrade Integration** - CTA component connecting to existing Stripe subscription system

## Out of Scope

- Actual chart data visualization and charting library integration
- Real-time data updates and WebSocket connections
- Advanced filtering and date range selection beyond dropdown placeholders
- Profile management functionality (handled by existing profile routes)
- Data entry forms (handled by existing data-entry routes)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully responsive dashboard page that adapts between desktop sidebar and mobile bottom navigation layouts
2. Interactive navigation with active state management and routing to existing CPN pages
3. Statistics cards displaying placeholder data with proper formatting and trend indicators


The touchable menu icons for mobile should be from left to right:
1. Dashboard
2. Analytics
3. Add
4. Share
5. In
6. Leaderboards
