# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-responsive-dashboard-ui/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Responsive Layout System**: Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts that adapt between desktop (sidebar navigation) and mobile (bottom tab navigation) using Tailwind breakpoints (md: 768px+)
- **Component Architecture**: Build reusable React components for NavigationSidebar, BottomTabNavigation, StatsCard, ChartPlaceholder, and ActivityFeed using TypeScript
- **State Management**: Integrate with existing Next.js App Router patterns and utilize React Server Components where possible for optimal performance
- **Navigation Integration**: Connect navigation items to existing CPN routes (/dashboard, /add-girl, /data-entry, /profiles, /analytics, /subscription)
- **Touch Optimization**: Implement 44px minimum touch targets for mobile navigation and ensure gesture-friendly interactions
- **Performance Targets**: Meet PWA requirements with <1.2s First Contentful Paint on 3G networks and maintain <100KB initial JS bundle size
- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Design System Compliance**: Use existing CPN color tokens (cpn-yellow, cpn-dark, cpn-white, cpn-gray) with proper opacity variants for consistency
- **Data Integration**: Connect statistics cards to existing database queries for user spending, profile count, and activity metrics via Server Actions
- **Premium Integration**: Implement Stripe subscription upgrade flow connection using existing subscription management system

## External Dependencies

- **Lucide React Icons** - Modern icon library for navigation and stat card icons
- **Justification:** Lightweight, tree-shakeable icon library that aligns with the modern design requirements and provides consistent iconography across the dashboard interface
