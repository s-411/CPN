# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Design System Foundation
> Created: 2025-08-23

## Overview

Establish a comprehensive design system foundation with consistent brand colors, typography, and component styling that will be used throughout the entire CPN application. This foundational system ensures visual consistency, improves development efficiency, and creates a professional user experience aligned with the brand identity for data-driven men aged 18-45.

## User Stories

### Consistent Visual Identity
As a user, I want the app to have a cohesive, professional appearance across all pages and components, so that I trust the platform with my personal data and feel confident in its quality.

Users will experience consistent colors, typography, and button styling throughout their journey from landing page to dashboard. The dark theme with yellow accents creates a masculine, data-focused aesthetic that appeals to the target demographic while ensuring readability and accessibility.

### Developer Experience
As a developer, I want a centralized design system with predefined colors, fonts, and component styles, so that I can build features efficiently without making individual design decisions for each component.

Developers will have access to Tailwind CSS custom configurations, CSS custom properties, and utility classes that automatically apply brand colors and typography. This reduces development time and eliminates inconsistencies across team members.

### Brand Recognition
As a business stakeholder, I want the app's visual design to reinforce brand recognition and differentiate from competitors, so that users associate quality and professionalism with our platform.

The distinctive color palette (#f2f661 yellow, #1f1f1f dark backgrounds) and premium typography (National 2 Condensed Bold, Es Klarheit Grotesk) creates a memorable brand experience that stands out in the dating/analytics app market.

## Spec Scope

1. **Color System Configuration** - Define primary color palette (#f2f661, #1f1f1f, #ffffff, #ABABAB) in Tailwind CSS and CSS custom properties
2. **Typography System** - Integrate National 2 Condensed Bold for headings and Es Klarheit Grotesk for body text with proper font loading
3. **Button Component System** - Create consistent button styles with 100px border radius and yellow accent colors
4. **Global CSS Reset** - Establish baseline styling and dark theme defaults for the entire application
5. **Tailwind Configuration** - Extend default Tailwind config with custom brand colors and typography settings

## Out of Scope

- Individual page layouts or complex component designs
- Animation or transition specifications
- Responsive breakpoint definitions beyond typography scaling
- Icon library customization or brand iconography
- Advanced component variants (modals, dropdowns, forms) - these will be addressed in future specs

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Design System** - All brand colors and fonts are available as Tailwind utility classes and work across all components
2. **Typography Display** - Headings use National 2 Condensed Bold and body text uses Es Klarheit Grotesk with proper fallbacks
3. **Button Consistency** - All buttons display with 100px border radius and consistent styling using the yellow accent color
4. **Dark Theme Implementation** - Dark backgrounds (#1f1f1f) are default with proper text contrast (#ffffff, #ABABAB)
5. **Developer Documentation** - Clear documentation of available color classes, typography classes, and usage guidelines
